Alternative Validation Options\n\n## 🔧 **Choose Your Validation Method:**\n\nThis notebook now provides **two validation approaches**:\n\n### **Option 1: vLLM Validation (Original)**\n- **Pros**: Fastest inference, most precise probability calculations\n- **Cons**: Hardware compatibility issues with certain GPU/model combinations\n- **Use when**: You have compatible hardware and need maximum speed\n\n### **Option 2: Standard Transformers Validation (New)**\n- **Pros**: Universal compatibility, works with any Unsloth model, reliable\n- **Cons**: Slower than vLLM, but still faster than training\n- **Use when**: vLLM has compatibility issues or you want guaranteed reliability\n\n**Both methods produce identical metrics and visualizations** - the choice is purely based on your hardware compatibility and speed requirements.","metadata":{}},{"id":"4ef0213e","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# TT-11: Validation-Focused Training with Unsloth + vLLM\n\nThis notebook implements the same validation-focused approach as TT-10, but optimized for **maximum speed and accuracy**:\n\n**Key Improvements over TT-10:**\n- **🚀 Unsloth Training**: 2x-5x faster fine-tuning than standard PEFT\n- **🎯 vLLM Inference**: Most accurate AUC calculations with precise log probabilities\n- **💾 Memory Efficient**: Optimized for 2x T4 GPU setup\n- **⚡ Best Performance**: Fastest training + most accurate validation\n\n**Methodology:**\n- **Training**: Model learns from positive/negative examples using Unsloth (like test-time training)\n- **Validation**: Model predicts on real `body` comments with vLLM for precise probabilities\n- **Analysis**: Comprehensive metrics to understand generalization from examples to real data\n\n**Features:**\n- **Stratified Sampling**: Controllable % of training data while maintaining rule distribution\n- **Example-Based Training**: Similar to test-time training approach with Unsloth speed\n- **Real Comment Validation**: Test on actual comments with vLLM precision\n- **Comprehensive Metrics**: AUC, F1, Recall, Precision, Confusion Matrix\n- **Visualizations**: Performance plots and analysis\n- **4-bit + LoRA**: Memory-efficient training, vLLM-compatible inference\n\n**Benefits:**\n- **Fastest Training**: Unsloth provides 2x-5x speed improvement\n- **Most Accurate AUC**: vLLM gives precise probability calculations\n- **Best of Both
